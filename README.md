# 😃 Facial Emotion Detection with Deep Learning

This project tackles the challenge of identifying human emotions from facial expressions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It uses the widely-known FER-2013 dataset, training a model that can classify emotions like anger, happiness, surprise, and more.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Loads and processes the FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle
- Applies image preprocessing techniques for model robustness
- Constructs a CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trains the model to recognize emotions from grayscale face images
- Evaluates performance with accuracy and loss plots
- Predicts emotions on unseen data

## 📦 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection.git
cd emotion-detection
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib kagglehub
```

3. **Download the FER-2013 dataset**
> You must have your Kaggle API credentials configured.

```python
import kagglehub
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("msambare/fer2013")
```

4. **Run the notebook**
Open `Face_Emotion_Prediction.ipynb` and run all cells.

## 🎯 Emotion Categories

The model is trained to recognize the following classes:

- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral

---

## 📊 Model Performance

During training, the model’s performance is visualized with plots showing:

- Accuracy vs. Epoch
- Loss vs. Epoch

These help identify overfitting or underfitting behavior.
